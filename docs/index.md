# Gravity \| Density

by Anonymous Artists

_Gravity \| Density_ is a work for cyber-hacked devices and Web Audio applications with thematic material drawn from humankind's fascination with the universe.

In _Gravity \| Density_, we begin by manipulating fixed-audio sources through the performance of hacked CD players. The sonic results of this mangled audio is sampled and then distributed to the audienceâ€™s mobile devices in both passive and interactive manners. Passive distributions allow us to create intricately-spatialized rhythmic interplay between the glitching CD players and the blanket of overlapping samples dispersed throughout the networked audience.  Active distributions allow the audience to join in our performance; by sampling small portions of the audio, processing and looping these sounds and sending them back to the performers, we string this audio together and feed it into a cyber-controlled distortion pedal before sending it back to the audience for more manipulation. This results in overlapping cycles of control and audio generation between performer, audience, network, and machine.
