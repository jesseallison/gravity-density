To Fix:

- [ ] Audio files can be saved easily as .ogg and used on laptops and Android, but not on iOS devices. They can be saved as .wav and used on all 3, but it has a large file size -- also, right now the .wav file headers are not formatted properly and still won't load on iOS devices... simply opening them in an audio app and re-saving them allows them to be loaded -- Ergo, either fix the wav file corruption, or set up a service on the server that takes the blobs and compresses them using ffmpg to create mp3 files.
